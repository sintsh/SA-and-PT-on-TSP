Simulated Annealing and Parallel Tempering on Travel Salesman Problem

A number of algorithms are used to obtain an optimal solution for different problems having a
huge search space. The algorithms can be categorized as Informed (heuristic) and Uninformed
(blind) algorithms based on their search strategies. Simulated annealing (SA) is one of the most
popular and intelligent optimization algorithms which is categorized in heuristic algorithms.
These algorithms use a problem-specific evaluation and neighborhood function. Simulated
annealing algorithm, which was first independently presented as a search algorithm for
combinatorial optimization problems, is a popular iterative metaheuristic algorithm widely used
to address discrete and continuous optimization problems. The other effective algorithm is the
parallel tempering which is also used for combinatorial optimization. Parallel tempering (PT),
also called replica exchange or simulated tempering is a Monte Carlo method intended primarily
for sampling a probability distribution function with a complex structure. This paper proposes an
effective local search algorithm based on simulated annealing and parallel tempering techniques
to solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP). The travelling salesman problem is when given a
list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the shortest possible route is to visit
each city exactly once and return to the origin city. It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial
optimization. Our objective in this paper is to implement parallel tempering and simulated
annealing on the traveling salesman problem. We will compare the performance of the two and
also show how different choices of parameters affect the simulation results and performance.
